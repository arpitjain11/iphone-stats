Simple script for summarizing downloads from App Store.

To see daily downloads, download daily reports from iTunes Connect, and run the following command. Replace REPORT_DIR with the directory that contains the downloaded report.

gzip -cd REPORT_DIR/*.gz | stat.rb date

You can change "date" to "country" to see downloads by countries.
